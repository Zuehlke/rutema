          <h2>Even the best intentions...</h2>
          <p>...will not save you if your client has to do all the work.</p>
          <p>Rutema is flexible, almost too flexible. You can pick and choose which parts to use and in practical day-to-day usage this has been done. One example is a tool that generates Excel documents presenting requirements coverage using the base parser.</p>
          <p>The problem with all this flexibility is that you probably don't know what to do with it to begin with.<br>
            So Rutema comes with a few bonuses to get you started.</p>
          <p>
          Installation is very easy:<br>
          <pre>gem install rutema</pre>
          Make sure you install all required gems.<br>
          <h2>Out of the box</h2>
          Installing the gem adds three rutema related commands to the system:
          <ul>
            <li>rutemax is the command that executes tests based on a configuration</li>
            <li>rutemah is a tool to create simple reports froma database of rutemax test results</li>
            <li>rutemaweb is a web frontend for any database of rutemax test results</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Simple usage</h2>
          From version 0.4.2 rutema comes with a sample called distro_test that illustrates the minimal usage rutemax can be put to. Theres a whole <a href="distro_test.html">chapter</a> about it.
          <h2>Advanced usage</h2>
          <p>
            Rutema's base parser does not produce runnable scenarios.<br/> 
            The MinimalXML parser is intended as an example and it serves as a simple tool that will let the developers create the first tests, a critical mass that will lead to the creation of a test DSL<br/>
            It is really not practical to maintain many test specifications where the paths and parameters are hardcoded in command elements.<br/>
            The best way, actually the only way, to take full advantage of Rutema's capabilities is to write your own parser, one that will speak your project's DSL and make life easier for testers and developers alike.<br/>
            Rutema tries to make it easy, but there is no going around it.
          </p>
          <p>So after the installation comes the planning stage, where one defines the DSL and implements the parser.<br>
            In planning the parser, you inadvertedly influence the configuration of you project. <a href="configuration.html">Rutema's configuration</a> allows you to pass values such as tools and paths, plus other contextual data (i.e. version information) to the various Rutema components.
          </p>
          <p>
          The same can be said for what comes at the tail end of rutema's work: reporting. Here, the basic report produced by rutema is OK but still limited to the last run with no history.<br>
          Just like with the parser, you can write your own reporter, but in this case we can provide you with more meaningful reporter implementations.<br>
          A reporter that saves test results in a database using <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ActiveRecord">Active Record</a> is available, as is an email reporter.
          </p>
          <h2>Let's test something</h2>
          <p>
          Finally, after the parser is implemented and the configuration is done, you can use Rutema's test execution tool.
    <pre>
Usage: rutemax [options] command|filename
Options:
    -d, --debug                      Turns on debug messages
    -c, --config FILE                Loads the configuration from FILE
    -l, --log FILE                   Redirects the log output to FILE
        --check                      Runs just the check test
    -V, --version                    Displays the version
    -h, -?, --help                   This text
The commands are:
    all                            Runs all tests
    attended                       Runs all attended tests
    unattended                     Runs all unattended tests
You can also provide a specification filename in order to run a single test
    </pre>
    </p>
    <h2>Shooting ourselves in the foot!</h2>
    <p>
      In all honesty, experience shows that each project has different requirements on what a tool like Rutema should do.<br>
      And the basic interface never seems enough, once you get used to doing things automagically.<br>
      The hottest issue is executing groups of tests according to one criterion or another, usually based on an attribute of the specification or the scenario.</p>
      <p>
      Experience shows that classification attributes within the XML are better avoided, for maintainability if not for any other reason.<br> 
      There is also the question of scale for a file based system like the one shown here.<br>
      In order to execute queries over the sum of specifications, they all need to be parsed. Real-world data shows it will not scale well past the 1000 specifications mark using the REXML based parser. Using a C based XML parser should significantly increase speeds though.
      </p><p>
      The use of a database for storing specifications has at this point been consciously discarded as the primary goal was to make creation of the specifications easy and not create another GUI tool with it's own editor.<br>
      A text format is also a lot easier to extend/change without breaking a lot of things while versioning can be easily delegated to a version control system making Rutema's implementation that much simpler.
      </p><p>
      Ofcourse, nobody keeps you from replacing the parser with a DB access layer, replacing Rutema::Coordinator to provide a richer interface and adding an editor that updates the database for good measure. We expect you to donate the code to the project when everything is up, running and well tested :).
