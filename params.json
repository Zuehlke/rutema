{"name":"rutema","tagline":"test execution tool aimed at simplifying test result collection and analysis","body":"##rutema\r\nrutema is a test execution tool and a framework for organizing and managing test execution across different tools.\r\n\r\nIt enables the combination of different test tools while it takes care of logging, reporting, archiving of results and formalizes execution of automated and manual tests.\r\n\r\nIt's purpose is to make testing in heterogeneous environments easier. \r\n\r\n###Why?\r\nRequire consistency, repeatability and reliability from your test infrastructure while gathering data on every run.\r\n\r\nWhether running through a checklist of manual steps, or executing a sequence of fully automated commands we always want to know if a test has failed, where it failed and what was the state of the system at that time.\r\n\r\nrutema will gather all logs, timestamp them, store them and report on them. \r\n\r\nrutema core provides a reference implementation of a parser for a simple but extensible XML test specification format which works well out of the box but the framework provides clearly defined interfaces so you can write the parser for your own format and add reporters that log wherever is needed.","google":"UA-20077869-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
