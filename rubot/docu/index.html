					<p>Rubot is a distributed build management system for the support of Continuous Integration. It aims to automate the execution of builds and handle reporting and archiving of build artifacts.
					</p>
					<p>
						It started as a Ruby implementation of the ideas behind BuildBot and broadly follows it's architecture.</p>
						<h3>Why another CI system?</h3>
					<p>
						There are a few reasons why Rubot is being developed. At the time where the system started, <a href="http://buildbot.net/trac">BuildBot</a> could only be hosted on *nix systems and the Rubot team had to live with Windows servers.<br/>
						No other CI system seems to be able to handle a highly heterogeneous build system (initially Rubot was developed to handle the build requirements for a project that used VS6.0, VS2003, a dmake build wth an embedded compiler, an MSBuild for a C# tool and various Ruby support applications) - at least that was the case at the time we took the decision to create Rubot.
						</p><p>
						Last, but not least, <a href="../rutem/index">rutema</a> was already in production and coincidentally used a similar (if scaled down) architecture that allowed us to reuse a lot of the code (some of it now lives in the <a href="../index.html">patir</a> project).<br/>
						Once Rubot reaches release status expect modules that will offer rutema integration out of the box.
