=== 1.0.4 / 2010-04-23
* Fixed manifest missing entry for the flot lib
* Added timeline diagrams per config
* Scenarios in a run are now listed in ascending order of start time 
* Custom settings solution scrapped in favor for Sinatra's settings.
* Settings expanded to include last n runs number
* IMPORTANT: a configuration file is now needed instead of the sqlite3 database file, as rutema_web should now be able to connect to all activerecord databases. The configuration file is a yaml dump of {:db=>{:adapter=>'sqlite3', :database=>'rutema_test.db'}, :settings=>{ :page_size=>10, :last_n_runs=>20, :port=>7000, :show_setup_teardown=>true}}
* Statistics now use a drop down list instead of a bunch of buttons - tidier UI
=== 1.0.3 / 2009-12-17
* Replaced gruff with flot removing the gruff/RMagick/ImageMagick dependency
* Trivial caching of statistic data implemented to speed up graph display
=== 1.0.2 / 2009-09-10
* Cleared up the gem dependencies
* Upgraded gruff
=== 1.0.1 / 2009-07-31
* not executed test cases now show up in the statistics graphs in yellow. This gives us the trend in test case numbers
=== 1.0.0 / 2009-07-17
* updated gem dependencies for active_record (2.3.2)
* renamed gem to rutema_web for consistency
* switched from ramaze to sinatra
* no more require "rubygems" in the code. The rutema_web script will do this.
* gem dependencies are enforced in a separate file
* fixed the folding javascript - now using jQuery
* updated the project infrastructure (hoe etc.)

=== 0.9.5 / 2008-11-28
* Overlooked conditional in Statistics index action fixed
=== 0.9.4 / 2008-11-28
* Configuration file column added to run overview
* More code to check for old OpenStruct instances of context
* statistics graphs
* rutemaweb now depends on gruff (and consequently on RMagick/ImageMagick) for the generation of graphs - It will work without but if you want the pretty colors you need gruff.

* Fixed bug in display of run list (context incorrectly used)
=== 0.9.2 / 2008-11-05
* failure rate added in scenario overview
